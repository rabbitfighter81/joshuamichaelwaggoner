She came to us with the racing name L.R’s Karol, but it didn’t fit. Raven is well mannered, incredibly good with humans, and is very active. She is young, quick, affectionate, and loves to cuddle."

This was the first rescue that I was in on from the ground up, and my first time partnering with CGA (Colorado Greyhound Adoption). Gabby lived a long life, was loved very much and is missed just as much still."

He was my first exposure to greyhounds and although he was marred by a traumatic life, we had fun and he was able to overcome many problems. He lived a long life, was loved very much, and ate lots of food."
