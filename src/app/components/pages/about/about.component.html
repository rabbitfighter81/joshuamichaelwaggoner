        My name is Joshua Michael Waggoner and I am a Full Stack UI Developer
        from Denver, Colorado, soon-to-be residing in Spokane, WA in late July of 2019.
        I'm so excited to take this next step in life, I have always wanted to live in
        the pacific northwest and I'm ready to find my next role where I can make
        a huge impact and make awesome software! My interests include JavaScript and TypeScript,
        Node, Angular 2/4/5/6/7, React, Redux, RxJs, D3, Web Sockets, Material Design, and CX/UX.

        I am a proud greyhound parent and am an advocate for both rescue and the termination of greyhound racing.
        I collect records, cool toys, and memorabilia, and am also interested in cuisine, art,
        film, video games, and music composition.
