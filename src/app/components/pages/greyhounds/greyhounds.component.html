        I love these dogs because so many of them come from tragic environments, and are sometimes unruly at first,
        making them an unlikely choice for many families and individuals. But with time, triaing, and love, these dogs can become virtual couch
        potatoes that will love you until you or they die, and that unless we rescue them, they could be alone, unhappy, or even worse could be sent to a kill shelter.

        I believe that it is every American's duty to participate and care for the one thing that separates us from being a Banana Republic: The Constitution, and playing a part in our experiment in free market democracy requires all people to participate to truly be effective and representative.
        Reaching 100% involvement at all levels is ideal but asking more of people is not. Regardless of party, candidate, or other affiliation, playing a part in our electoral
        and civic processes shuold be considered the norm, not just half or less than the population. I do what I can to reach out to voters and I do what I can for my city, state, and country.
        I believe we should leave the world in a better place than the previous generation left us. Whatever it is you do, get involved at some level.
