        I love these dogs because so many of them come from tragic environments,
        and are sometimes unruly at first, making them an unlikely choice for
        many families and individuals. But with time, triaing, and love, these
        dogs can become virtual couch potatoes that will love you until you or
        they die, and that unless we rescue them, they could be alone, unhappy,
        or even worse could be sent to a kill shelter.
