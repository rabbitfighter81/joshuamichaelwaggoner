          My name is Joshua Michael Waggoner and I am a Full Stack/UI Developer
          living in Spokane, WA. I just re-located from Denver, CO in late July
          of 2020. I'm so excited to take this next step in life, I have always
          wanted to live in the pacific northwest and I'm ready to find my next
          role where I can make a huge impact and make awesome software! My
          interests include Node, JavaScript and TypeScript, Angular, React, React Native, NativeScript, Ionic, Elm, Angular
          Material, NgRx, RxJs React/Redux, D3, Web Sockets, and CX/UX.

          I am a proud greyhound parent and am an advocate for both rescue and the
          termination of greyhound racing. I collect records, cool toys, and
          memorabilia, and am also interested in cuisine, art, film, video games,
          and music composition.
