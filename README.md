# JoshuaMichaelWaggoner.com

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

* Run `npm run serve-en` for a dev server in English. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/en/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

* For Spanish, execute `npm run serve-es`

* For German, execute `npm run serve-de`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

* Since *joshuamichaelwaggoner.com* is a multi language app, it has to be built for each locale.

* To build for just English locale, run `npm run build-localed`.

* To build for all locales, run `npm run locale-postbuild` which in turn runs `locale-postbuild.sh` script. This will take several minutes... 

## Running unit tests

* Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

* For better debuggin, execute `ng test --source-map=false`.

## Running end-to-end tests

Right now there are no e2e tests. 

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
